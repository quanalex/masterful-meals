            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>
                We will call/email up to a week in advance to discuss the date/time availability that you have on your
                end as well as what location you would like us to cook at. Additionally, we will inquire about the
                number of individuals who will be present on a given day, while also addressing allergies and aversions
                to certain foods that certain individuals may have.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, we will propose different types of meals that we can prepare, from our recipe bank which we
                have experimented with cooking in our test kitchen. Based upon what you decide for us to cook, if you
                have a preference, we will then provide an ingredient list of what is contained in the dish for you to
                further verify ingredients contained in the meal.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>The Day Of</h3>
            <p>

                Depending on what date/time we agree upon, we will arrive on site an hour before the start of the
                cooking demonstration to set up/prep ingredients. We will take into consideration potential hazards
                (knife handling, heat sources, raw meat etc.) to ensure the safety of participants throughout the set
                up and actual cooking demonstration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the commencement of the cooking demonstration, we will ask you to please sign our <a
                    href="documents/Waiver and Release Agreement  Swun Masterful Meals.pdf" target="_blank">Waiver and
                    Release Agreement</a>. We will then begin with an overall discussion of what we are cooking and talk
                about its nutritional
                benefits. Then every participant will receive a handprinted copy of the recipe of the meal that we will
                be preparing. The meals are designed to be individualized, so every participant will be able to prepare
                their own specific meal (if we prepare salmon, each participant will prepare their own salmon portion).
                We will model what to cook and the participants will follow along with the prepared ingredients. The
                preparation of the meal may take anywhere between 1-2 hours.
                After the meal is prepared, we will tidy/clean your kitchen facilities!

            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>
                Masterful Meals is a nonprofit organization partnered with the Casa Youth Shelter in Los Alamitos,
                California with the goal of changing the lives and habits of the younger generation, specifically youth
                at risk, by promoting healthy eating and self-sufficiency. At Masterful Meals, we are aware of the
                unique challenges faced by children in shelters, particularly those at the Casa Youth Shelter. We
                provide a beacon of hope and empowerment through our educational services and hands-on cooking
                demonstrations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our mission originates from the core belief that knowledge about healthy eating, especially in todayâ€™s
                day in age, is crucial. Children from underserved areas often reside in food deserts (areas that lack
                access to nutritious food) and introducing these children to healthy ingredients and eating is vital. We
                aim not only to educate but to inspire a passion for cooking easy-to-prepare meals.
            </p>

            <p>
                During sessions, children will participate in cooking demonstrations that are fun, enjoyable, and
                informative. These demonstrations are designed to equip them with the tools necessary to prepare healthy
                meals for themselves and their families, fostering a sense of independence and self-sufficiency. The
                road to a healthier and more nutritious lifestyle begins by creating changes early on in life. Our
                sessions are carefully formatted to emphasize the importance of nutrition while ensuring that the
                recipes are easy to follow and replicate.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Masterful Meals, we believe in the idea that education induces lasting change. By introducing young
                individuals to the joy of cooking and the benefits of a balanced diet, we aim to have the children carry
                healthy eating habits into adulthood. We envision children to be competent in making proper food choices
                in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Join us in our mission in promoting a culture of healthy eating, mastering your health, one meal at a
                time!
            </p>
